## Approach

The project follows a specific approach to achieve its goals. The key aspects of the implementation are described below.

### Architecture

The project is designed using a layered architecture pattern to ensure modularity and maintainability. It consists of the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer handles the user interface and interaction. It is implemented using Spring MVC framework to expose RESTful API endpoints.
- **Service Layer**: The service layer contains the business logic and performs operations based on the application requirements. It serves as an intermediary between the presentation and data access layers.
- **Data Access Layer**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database or any external data sources. It uses Spring Data JPA for seamless database operations.

### API Endpoints

The project provides various API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on recipes. Here are the main endpoints:

- `POST /recipes`: Create a new recipe.
- `GET /recipes/{id}`: Get the details of a recipe by its ID.
- `PUT /recipes/{id}`: Update an existing recipe.
- `DELETE /recipes/{id}`: Delete a recipe.

For more details on the available endpoints and request/response structures, please refer to the Swagger documentation.

###  Validation and Error Handling
Input validation is performed at various levels to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid requests from being processed. The application uses Spring Validation annotations to validate incoming request payloads.

Error handling is done using centralized exception handling mechanisms. Custom exception classes are used to capture specific error scenarios and return appropriate error responses to the client.

### Testing

The project includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implemented functionality. The tests are written using frameworks such as JUnit and Mockito.

### Deployment

The project can be deployed as a standalone Spring Boot application. It provides a Dockerfile for containerization and easy deployment to various cloud platforms.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment
The project is set up with a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to ensure smooth and automated build, test, and deployment processes. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI can be used to achieve this.

The deployment process includes packaging the application into a deployable artifact (e.g., a JAR file) and deploying it to a server or cloud platform.

### Search Strategy
I think most important part of the exercise

* Used Specification pattern for dynamic queries
* Factory pattern to register the operator strategies
* Fork and Join approach for individual specifications
  * so that joins won't kill us for performance later run
  * each of these table query run would independent and efficient in long run

### API versioning
* used header based versioning approach
